# signing-creds.sh - sole reader/writer of suzu's signing credentials file.
#
# The release pipeline (make codesign-setup / setup-notary / dist / release-
# publish) must be non-interactive from ANY session - SSH, cron, a CI runner -
# which rules out both 1Password (`op read` wants an interactive/biometric
# signin) and the login keychain (locked outside GUI sessions; and signing
# flows that touch the login keychain are the known re-prompt trap). So every
# signing secret lives in ONE plain KEY=value file OUTSIDE the repo, protected
# the same way ~/.ssh keys are: owned by the caller, mode 0600/0400. This script
# refuses anything looser, and every Makefile consumer goes through it so the
# policy has a single home.
#
# This is suzu's OWN credentials store, deliberately separate from any sibling
# project's (e.g. glimmer): different path, different keychain, different notary
# profile. One signing kit must never reach into another's.
#
# Default path: ~/.config/suzu/signing.env
# Override:     SUZU_SIGNING_CREDS env var (the Makefile exports it from its
#               SIGNING_CREDS variable, so `make dist SIGNING_CREDS=...` works).
#
# Subcommands:
#   path                  Print the resolved credentials-file path.
#   check                 Validate existence + ownership + permissions.
#   get KEY [--optional]  Print KEY's value. A missing key is an error unless
#                         --optional (then prints nothing, exits 0).
#   set KEY VALUE         Create or update KEY (creates the file 0600 if absent,
#                         never loosens an existing one). Atomic rewrite.
#   missing KEY...        Report every unset key among the args in one message.
#   fill-from-op          Fill empty keys from the 1Password item in OP_SOURCE.
#   init                  Write a commented template (refuses to overwrite).
#
# File format: one KEY=VALUE per line; the value is everything after the FIRST
# '=' - no quoting, no expansion, quotes would become part of the value. Lines
# starting with '#' are comments. The file is parsed, never sourced, so values
# cannot execute anything.
#
# Keys the Makefile consumes (none are read anywhere else):
#   SIGN_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD  password of the dedicated release-signing keychain
#                           (auto-generated + stored by `make codesign-setup`)
#   P12_PATH                absolute path to the Developer ID .p12 export
#   P12_PASSWORD            passphrase of that .p12
#   APPLE_ID                Apple ID email for notarytool
#   APPLE_APP_PASSWORD      app-specific password for notarytool
#   APPLE_TEAM_ID           (optional) 10-char team id; derived from the
#                           Developer ID cert name when absent
#   SPARKLE_ED_PRIVATE_KEY  EdDSA ed25519 private key for signing updates
#                           (generated once by `make sparkle-keys`)
